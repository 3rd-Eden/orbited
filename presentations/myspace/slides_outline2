<!-- (Part I - what is Comet + transports: 10 minutes) -->
Slide: Orbited Logo + Michael Carter

-My name is Michael Carter
- Founder Lead developer of Orbited
    - 2 years in development
    - countless architectures tested
    - now we've found the best
- Lead architect of Kaazing's Enterprise Comet Server offering
    - coming soon (to theatres everywhere...)

Slide: Comet

- Here to tell you about Comet
- Everything I've learned in two years of Comet work
- You probably already know what Comet is. But i'll say it again just in case.

Slide: What is Comet

- Its about asynchronous updates in the browser (Pushing data)
- Not necessarily about a particular technology
    - could be flash
    - polling
    - javascript hacks (streaming)
- Its about an interaction model -- user is notified asap with new data
- Its about the applications that you can build with that interaction model
    - Chat, clearly
    - Financials
    - Gaming
    - Auctions
    - Sports reporting
    - Election Monitoring (Andrew Betts / London Paper)
    - Collaborative Editing
    - Air traffic control (no joke)
    - Network monitor reporting / system administration
    - To name a few
- In practice though, everyone wants Comet without the need for flash
- Just plain old js and html
- Which brings us to Transports

Slide: Transports
- These are the actual mechanisms for delivering data
- There are many

Slide: Iframe

- Originally we had script tag streaming
- but it made sense to put it in an iframe
- So we refer to it now as iframe streaming

Slide: Iframe Diagram

- Parent page has a callback "receive"
- Finishes loading, creates and iframe
- Iframe causes an HTTP request to the server
- the server sends headers
- (transfer-encoding chunked for http 1.1)
- And then stops
- The key to this transport is incremental rendering
- Browser will try to display any open/close tag pair that it receives
- This includes displaying invisible elements, like script tags
- So the server can cause the browser to execute arbitrary javascript
- <script>parent.receive("payload!");</script>

Slide: Iframe Code
- Easy to implement
- Works in all browsers with the same code
- Suffers from..

Slide: Iframe Usability
- Loading Bars
- Hour glasses
- clicking noises?! (wtf mate ^^)

Slide: Iframe Unacceptable
- Modern applications can't have clicking noises and hour glasses. 
- The users would get too confused
- So Iframe streaming isn't that popular
- Instead, the winner is...

Slide: XHR Long polling

- Long polling is what the cool kids do.
- (Meebo and Facebook, for instance)

Slide: XHR diagram

- Browser says, 'Give me an event'
- Server says, '...'
- Server says, 'event.'
- Browser says, 'Give me an event'
- server says '...'
- Its cross-browser

Slide: Long polling code
- still easy to implement
- and no usability issues!
- but how does long polling performance compare to iframe streaming?
- Consider an island off the coast
- its surrounded by water

Slide: Island
- We want to send conveys to the island, so we build a bridge

Slide: Bridge
- Conveys can now go to the island as they please
- But maybe a big ugly bridge is not what we wanted... its too unsightly
- So instead we build a boat

Slide: A boat
- The convey arrives at the boat, and the boat takes it to the island
- no problem
- But what about the second convey that arrived just after the boat leaves?
- It waits for the boat to go to the island
- It waits for the boat to come back
- It gets on, and waits for the boat to go to the island
- Well Iframe streaming is the bridge, and the boat is long polling
- Meaning, long polling suffers from a 3x latency performance hit
- But thats not all
Slide: Bandwidth comparison
- You also have to send headers all the time
- Your buddy says 'how's it hanging'
- But the browser says 'GET /some/url HTTP/1.1\r\nUser-Agent: ...etc'
- And the server says 'HTTP/1.1 200 ok\r\nContent-type....'
- your 15 byte message can easily incur 300 bytes of headers
- thats a 20x bandwidth increase in that case

Slide: Long polling unacceptable
- 3x latency is too much
- 20x bandwidth is too much

Slide: Strike 2, you're out
- Strike 2, you're out
- or so we thought

Slide: Htmlfile Object
- htmlfile object to the rescue

Slide: ActiveX!
- but safe for scripting
- hides usability issues

Slide: Garbage crossout
- leaks live connections on navigations
- But we can fix that by explicitly calling the garbage collector

Slide: Htmlfile works great
- Streaming
- But No side effects
Slide: Explorer only
- partial solution
Slide: Xhr Streaming
- transport for ff and safari
Slide: ready state 3
- ready state 3 saves the day
- callbacks for download progress from server
- responseText is just plain text without any inherent meaning

Slide: Manually parse
- So invent our own format
- parse it manually
- And we're set for firefox and safari
- Without loading bars or anything
- and the same bandwidth and latency constraints of iframe streaming
- So we've got all the browsers
- Except opera

Slide: SSE

- Opera goes above and beyond the call of duty
- I don't ask that browser's make my life easy
- They can keep their nasty forest of terrible hacks
- All I ever asked from browsers is that they make it possible to do comet
- But Opera actually makes comet a first class citizen of the browser
- Create an event source, name a url, add a listener. The end.

Slide: Html5

- Then they went on to propose that the this be included in HTML5
- after discussions with other vendors, a new spec came up

Slide: deprecated

- so the new one isn't implemented
- but thats okay
- we can use the deprecated one in opera 8+

Slide: Transport Conclusions
- You've seen the prettier side of Comet
- Ten minutes to explain 
- Years to discover

Slide: hacks
- And yes, its hacks, hacks hacks

Slide: aim carefully
- Developing these transports is like trying to throw darts at a board

Slide: moving target
- but the board moves after you've thrown the dart
- That is to say, just imagine the most frustrating game you can
- That game is twice as fun as building transports
- But in the end

Slide: sleek bridge
- We can avoid the boat transport (long polling)
- And provide great user experience

Slide: sleek bridge image with orbited logo superimosed
- And orbited does just that

<!-- (Part II - Scaling Comet - 8 Minutes) -->

Slide: Scalability
- Once you have a way to do comet, you need to scale it
- where transports are frustrating, scaling is hard
- Step 1,

Slide: Vertical Scalability
- How do you put lots of users on one machine?
- Seems like such a hard problem, but really there's a simple trick
- And once you know the trick, its easy
- Don't use threads.
- People  have tried this with servers like apache
- So a reasonable thread count, of 20, will service 20 users
- A better user count is a 1000 though
- But a 1000 threads brings a system to its knees with context switches
- No comet, just thrashing
- So use the little trick of omitting threads, and you're golden
- Build event-based servers
- Your comet apps won't have to be like nature preserves
- You don't want your app to be a lonely desert with the occasional wanderer
- it should be a riot, with users tearing down the walls, sucking your resources dry, demanding more...

Slide: desert -> riot
- So use event based programming for your comet server

Slide: zzzz
This is the easy problem
The harder problem is the other "half" of scaling,

Slide: Horizontal Scalability
- This is a truly tough problem
- Really though, it depends on the application
- But a few core rules are in order
- 1. Don't share state between comet servers
- 2. Only do Comet in the Comet server. no Pub/sub, no jabber/game server, just comet
- 3. Treat comet as the last leg of the journey

Slide: Two Comet servers (sharded by user) doing pub sub (ajaxworld slide)
- For some reason, comet servers are all trying to provide a pub/sub api
- Developers like it, great.
- But it was already a hard problem before Browser's existed
- And the people solving the problem, RabbitMQ/ActiveMQ, aren't part of the comet community.
- Integrating comet would real publish/subscribe message queues would be great
- But, thats just a specific case of a larger issue
- And really, integrating comet with existing technologies would allow us to solve the horizontal scaling problem however these existing technologies already solve it.
- So How do you integrate comet servers with X?

<!-- (Part III - Integrating Comet - 10 Minutes) -->

Slide: Offboard Comet integrated with Jabber
- This is an example of how a typical comet server is integrated with jabber.
- the browser maintains a connection with the comet server and the "bridge"
- The bridge is an http server (hopefully event based as well!)
- and also an xmpp client
- and also a "Comet client" (dispatch protocol)
- Message flow goes browser -> bridge -> jabber -> bridge -> comet -> browser

Slide: A lolcat tangled up
- This is a bit of a mess
- complex systems are hard to scale

Slide: previous slide (Offbard comet integrated with jabber)
- you can't scale this with your typical web load balancer
- the mapping between comet servers, bridges, and xmpp servers are almost certainly not giong to be 1-1
- so you have the complex task of figuring out load balancing between each part
- and then you have to implement each client twice
- once for the bridge, once for the browser
- the bridge speaks xmpp to the jabber server, but json-chat (made up protocol) to the browser

Slide: Victory march picture, maybe the planting of the american flag in some battle
- Standards save the day.
- HTML5 has specified a TCPConnection standard for the browser


Slide: TCPConnection (word)
- I've been working closely with whatwg/w3c to specify a protocol and api that solves all of our problems
- It will 
    -traverse forward proxies
    - speak ssl
    - include cookies (auth integration)
    - use a single socket for both directions
    - revolutionize web applications
- Think about it -- tcp connections revolutionized network programming in the 70s.
Slide: Iron Man screenshot during test sequence
- tcp/ip. Thats how dad did it, thats how america does it, and its worked out pretty well so far
- And we don't even have to wait for browser vendors

Slide: The future is now (sci-fi-ish picture + words?)
- Orbited provides a TCPConnection to all major browsers, today.

Slide: Browser < - > Comet Proxy < - > Jabber diagram
- Orbited speaks comet transports on the front
- and plain old tcp on the back
- So you put it in front of ANY tcp server
- and the browsers can interact as if they'd connected directly to the server over tcp.
- and the server doesn't need to be altered at all.
- No need for a bridge or dispatch protocol
- but we can simplify this picture still

Slide: Browser < - > ( comet Proxy + Jabber Diagram single machine)
- Treat the comet proxy as part of the server
- One comet proxy per backend server
- Now you can all sigh in relief

Slide: Sigh of relief
- Because Comet isn't going to get in the way anymore
- Scaling Comet applications isn't a twofold problem anymore
- If you know how to scale a network application, then you can scale a comet application.

Slide: Jabber server cloud with half Comet proxies, half normal
- And whats more, there's no difference between the browser and the desktop
- You get to 


Slide: Auth + persistence (a pair of keys and some kind of storage)
- There are a couple of details: authentication and persistence

Slide: Jabber server with comet proxy on left, web app on the right, sql server behind both
- Just have the network server and the web app coordinate on the back end
- And your problems are over.

Slide:Conclusion  (Bullseye (with orbited logo somewhere))
- Transports are frustrating, but Orbited implements them (indeed, many projects take our implementation directly)
- Vertical Scalability and threads don't mix. Orbited use event-based network IO.
- Horizontal scalability is tough because you have two problems.
- If you can solve integration, then you can get a handle on horizontal scalability
- TCPConnection is the perfect integration point. It works with all past, present, and future tcp/ip servers. Out of the box.
- Orbited provides that functionality today.
