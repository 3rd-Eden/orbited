- m comet?
- m comet is
- j sounds like a socket
- j who uses a socket?
-m no, no no
-m firewalls routers
-m java/flash has this already
-j so whats this architecture for comet then?
-m ajax up, comet down, two servers
-j api
-m comet.receive(cb); where cb = function(data);
-j so you have ajax for send, and comet for receive
-m right
-j so thats just a socket. lets call it a socket. people in here already use sockets, so they'll like this
-m tomato toe-mah-to -- you're playing word games
-j well, how would you make an irc client?
-m so you admit you're playing word games
-j no, I'm illustrating a point. how would you make an irc client?
-m like this.... with a bridge
-j so is the browser actually getting all of the information that a desktop client
-m oh, of course. json. thats the whole point of the irc bridge.
-j ok, so what about xmpp
-m same way, with a bridge... 
-j ok, so this is my point. 
-j what a lot of people seem to think is that the socket is just a new name
-j dion almear for example
-j but its not just about this part, its about integration with the back
-j all these servers operate over TCP
-j and even with a bridge the browser has to understand each part of the protocol
-j so instead of writing a bridge each time, lets write a SINGLE bridge
-j one that bridges from comet + ajax to TCP
-j then we just implment the protocol in the browser
-j and not write any additional server code.
-m whoa slow down there
